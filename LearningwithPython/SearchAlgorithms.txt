ALGORITHM
An algorithm is simply a list of statements which can be converted into code and executed by a computer on different sets of inputs. 

Edge Cases: 
Some of these (like the empty array or query not found) are called edge cases, as they represent rare or extreme examples.
While edge cases may not occur frequently, our programs should be able to handle all edge cases, otherwise it  may fail in unexpected ways. 

Linear search algorithm
It involves searching through a list in a linear fashion i.e. element after element.
Time complexity =O(n)

Binary search algorithm:
It involves searching through the half of list everytime  using two pointers left and right with appropriate conditions.
It works for sorted  list.

Time and Space complexity:

1. The time complexity of the algorithm is cN for some fixed constant c that depends on the number of operations we perform in each iteration and the time taken to execute a statement. Time complexity is sometimes also called the running time of the algorithm.

2. The space complexity is some constant c' (independent of N), since we just need a single variable position to iterate through the array, and it occupies a constant space in the computer's memory (RAM).

Asymtotic Notation:

Big O Notation: Worst-case complexity is often expressed using the Big O notation. In the Big O, we drop fixed constants and lower powers of variables to capture the trend of relationship between the size of the input and the complexity of the algorithm.

i.e. if the complexity of the algorithm is cN^3 + dN^2 + eN + f,in the Big O notation it is expressed as O(N^3)
