Binary search Algorithm :

    1. Find the middle element of the list. 
    2. If it matches queried number, return the middle position as the answer. 
    3. If it is less than the queried number, then search the first half of the list 
    4. If it is greater than the queried number, then search the second half of the list 
    5. If no more elements remain, return -1. 
    
    
 time complexity  of binary search =O(log N). 
 space complexity of binary search =O(1)
 
 This fact is often stated as: binary search runs in logarithmic time.
